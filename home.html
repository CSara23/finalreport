<h2>Team Retrospect</h2>
<p>This week, the team had a great sprint. Stories were fledged out and the user journeys helped to make implementation easier.</p>
<p>Development wise, the roles are now clearer. Some members of the team will focus on technical implementation, whilst others will focus on requirement analysis and UI design.</p>
<p>Moving forward, it is anticipated that this will help the team work faster due to clarity.</p>
<p>The core challenge face this week, technically was form validation. This was a piece of work that was pull into the sprint as the team had capacity. The team did a spike that included reviewing review the golang documentation and thus the output will be used to implement the validations in the next sprint.</p>
<p>Another challenge was communication. The team needs to communicate better so that efforts will not be wasted</p>
